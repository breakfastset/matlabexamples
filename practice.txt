Write a MATLAB program using MATLAB commands to:
Read 5 values (number of people) into a vector called people
Read 5 values (age of people) into a vector called ages
Plot a graph of ages against people using ‘.-‘ as line style and ‘o’ as marker.
Print the output of median, mean, standard deviation and variance




[C]

Given that there are 2 files mat1.dat and mat1.dat containing values 10 float values and 10 integer values respectively, write MATLAB script to load the files into vec1 and vec2.

Plot vec2 against vec1

[ E ]

Write a MATLAB program to calculate the BMI of a person.
The program will ask for the weight and height of person in kg and m respectively.
Display the BMI using the formula weight divided by square of height.


Evaluate the following MATLAB programs and state the output. If the output has more than 1 answer, state the range of the output.


some_num = randi([1,5]); disp(some_num);

arr = ones(3); disp(arr);
arr = zeros(10);
disp(arr);

arr = 2:10; result = sum(arr); disp(result);
result = mean(arr);
disp(result);

arr = [3 8 4 10; 7 0 -1 3; 4 5 -3 7]; result = min(arr); disp(result);
result = max(arr);
disp(result);

arr = [2 5 1 3 4 5]; result = cumprod(arr); disp(result);
result = cumsum(arr);
disp(result);
